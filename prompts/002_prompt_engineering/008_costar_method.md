We are a scaling startup that has gotten by with our N-tier application, single database and directly serving pages to our customers. We are starting to see that our success is creating performance issues serving content to our customers. 

We are being asked to present our plans for a new caching feature to the CTO and need you to perform some reaerach on the various cachine methods available and their product impact for our customers. 

Use semi-techncial, concise language and focus on factual impact analysis of potential caching solutions. Remain proifessional and factual at all stages. 

You are speaking to the CTO who has technical understanding but is not involved in the day to day develolment anymore. He did build the original product so be concious of any emotional attachment he may have to the orignal solution.

We should present a short concise impact statement for the current problem followed by three options with tradeoffs clearly identified.
