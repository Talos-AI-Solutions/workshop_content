Should we migrate our monolithic application to microservices?

Context:
- Team size: 5 developers
- Application: E-commerce platform built in Django, 80K lines of code
- Current issues: Slow CI/CD pipeline (45 min builds), difficulty onboarding new developers
- Traffic: 10K daily active users, peaks at 50K during sales
- Budget: Limited - small startup with 18 months runway
- DevOps maturity: Junior level - currently using simple Heroku deployment
